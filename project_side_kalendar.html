	<div class="project_text">
		<p>I always think its such a hassel to organise social events with friends. Back and forth conversations trying to keep track who is free when. I really wish I had a calender app that syncs with all my messanging apps and make appropriate time suggestions based on my calender settings, such as if I’m a morning person or evening person, etc...</p>

		<h2>Design Process</h2>
	</div>	

	<div class="project_text">
		<p>I usually start designing based on asking ‘what is core problem?’ What is the people problem here? Mostly using the ‘Jobs to be done’ framework and drilling down to the core issue. This step includes discovering and validating hypnosis with people.<br>

		<br>Then I would draw out a flow diagram working out different solution to solve the core problem then distill it to a few simple user journeys.<br>

		<br>After the journey is roughly set, I’ll brainstorm the visuals(tone of the product/brand) and start thinking about a design system that would work across the product. This phase includes how will the product scale and monetisation opportunities.<br>

		<br>Once the product design framework has been set I will then do rough design layouts and prototypes to test out solutions with people to see if they find the product easy to use and helps solve their problem.<br>

		<br>If the design solution is a success then I would refine and build the product. If not I would go back to the drawing board to work out what features/flow/visuals didn’t work, redesign and test until it works.</p>
