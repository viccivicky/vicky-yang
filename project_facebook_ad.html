		<h2>Context</h2>
	</div>	

		<div class="project_text">
			<p>
			In August 2016 I joined the <a class= "inline_link" href="https://www.facebook.com/audiencenetwork">Audience Network</a>team at Facebook. Audience Network is Facebook’s external ad network. That means, we serve ads from Facebook and display it on 3rd party apps, mobile websites and video streaming sites(publishers). Our publishers at the time include CandyCrush, Washington Post, DailyMotion and more...<br>

			<br>The core of my role is to design, innovate, and improve ad formats for ads outside of Facebook using the same Facebook ad information data structure.<br>

			<br>Day to day

			<br>Working with cross function team members to  to find product opportunities as well as experimenting, executing and delivering high quality designs. I also facilitate sprints and workshops with my team(s) to generate design ideas.<br>

			<br>My cross functional team is made of:<br>
			Product managers, Product Marketing Managers, Client Partners, Researcher, Engineering Leads, Engineering Manager and Data Scientist.<br>

			<h2>The Problem</h2>

		<div class="project_text">
			<h3>One size doesn't fit all</h3>
			<p>
			The Facebook ad design structure isn’t a one size fit all desgin for our all our publishers on mobile app, web and video. Especially within Facebook there are various ad formats(image, video, carousel etc...) to support our advistisers to ennhance their creatives. My job here was to create good ad format systems for our publisher and to discover new potienal ad formats to improve ad performance throughout the business.<br>

		<h2>The Problem</h2>
		<p>the previous design was hard for users to understand and to use as the copy doesn't really relate to what the users were seeing. Also the users have to log-in to Facebook then report the ad in a new browser.  I’ve made the reporting flow in-line and no Facebook log-in is required.
		</p>
	</div>	

	<div class="project_text">
		<h3>300% reporting increase</h3>
		<p>
		The first implemtation of ad reporting resulted in a 300% increase. Over time we’ve added reporting through different media surfaces. Eventually even the WhatsApp team wants to adapt the design. This is the most impactful self initiated project I've done for the company and me,  even the WhatsApp team wanted to use this design for their reporting flow.
